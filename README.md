# Pro README File Generator

## Pro README File Generator
This repository was created to allow the users to create a professional README.md file based on their answers to a set of questions that are created specifically to create the README.md file.

This project contain a few pages but the main page to run the README.md generator is located at index.js, this function is possible via nodeJS to allow the project to create files and in this project is to create README.md file based on set of questions.

This project is mainly focused on showing up my skills in JS with the integration of NodeJS libraries and improve on it as I progress my journey of learning full stack. 

The README.md file name will be created based on the project tile + "-README.md" as an example Weather-App-API-README.md.
